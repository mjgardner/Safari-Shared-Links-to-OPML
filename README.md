# Safari Shared Links to OPML

This is an XSLT script to convert macOS Safari Shared Links feeds to an OPML file, suitable for import to other feed readers.

In addition to the plain XSLT, I've included a ZIPped app bundle created with [Platypus](http://sveinbjorn.org/platypus/) that will run it for you from Finder. You can then either copy and paste the resulting OPML or save it to a file on your disk.
